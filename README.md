# CodeClauseInternship_Next-Word-Prediction-with-Deep-Learning-in-NLP
This project aims to develop a Next Word Prediction model using deep learning techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to predict the most likely next word given a sequence of input words, which can be useful in various NLP applications such as auto-completion, text generation, and language translation.
